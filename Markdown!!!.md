# **What choices did I make and why?**
When making my reposity, I deicded to make it **public** so that anyone in the class, including peers and the teachers, as well as anyone curious online is able to view it. 
I would be happy if any code I end up creating in this class end sup being helpful to someone online or to one of my peers. 
## License Explanation 
Next I decided to chose an **MIT license**. I chose this license because I wanted people to be able to freely use and modify my code. It is the license that was the easiest to understand and with very few restrictions. 
I like that the MIT license allows people to do anything they want with my code as long as they credit my work.
